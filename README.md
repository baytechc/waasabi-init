# Waasabi Installer

A self-contained [Deno](https://deno.land/) application that takes care of the automated provisioning of a new [Waasabi](https://waasabi.org) instance. The Installer uses a preset configuration (usually generated by [the Waasabi Configurator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waasabi)) to carry out the tasks needed for setting up the new Waasabi instance, and provides feedback through an ephemeral web service.
